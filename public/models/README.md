Place your exported Blender model here as `model.glb` (binary glTF) or `model.gltf` plus the associated files.

Recommended: export from Blender as a single `.glb` file (File → Export → glTF 2.0 → Format: "glTF Binary (.glb)").

When the file is in this folder, the dev server will serve it at `/models/model.glb` and the scene will load it automatically.
