# Devlog Entry - 11/12

## Introducing the team
- **Wendy Zhang** - Design Lead and Tools Lead
- **Taylor Pearce** - Engine Lead and Testing Lead

## Tools and Materials

### Engine
Phaser 3: We decided to use Phaser because we have familiarity with it and find it fairly simple and easy to use. It also has a plugin that can enable 3d capabitlities.

three.js: As we are using phaser, the easiest way to implement 3d is by using three.js. It is easy to learn and already has a very well established library with lots of examples. 

Cannon.js: Because we are using three.js, we figured that it would be smart to use cannon as it is very complimentary to three.js. Cannon will be the engine that gives us our physics and 3d world.

### Language
Javascript: We decided on using javascript as it is the language we are most familiar with and it works very well with all of our engines and libraries. 

CSS: We don't know exactly how much we will be using CSS but figured it might be good to have for style purposes similar to all of our projects thus far.

JSON: Because we are using Javascript, it made the most sense to use JSON as our data language.

### Tools
CodeSpaces: We decided that using Codespaces made the most sense because we have been using it all quarter and it has good collaborative capabilities.

GitHub Actions: We will be using GitHub Actions as our workflow because it is automated and something we are familiar with using.

Vite: For our build tool we will be using Vite as we have familarity and it is compatible with all of our languages and engines. 

Blender: For our 3d editor, we decided on using blender. We chose this because it is a free tool with a very established community and it works with all of our other tools and engines.

### Generative AI
Claude: While we are not super familiar with Claude, we think it might be a good tool to use for this project as it is a code based LLM. And although it has agentic abilities, we will probably just stick to using it as an LLM.

Copilot: Contrary to Claude, we have more experience with Copilot and will most likely be using its agentic qualities. Specifically, we will be giving very explecit instructions as to not have it code the entire game.


## Outlook
For this project we want to focus on making the 3d aspects as polished as possible. However, this is also going to be the hardest part as we have little to no experience with 3d rendering. This is also inherently risky as without much knowledge, it is going to be difficult to get the 3d aspects as polished as we want them to be. We hope that by focusing on these aspects that we are unfamiliar with, that we learn a lot of valuable information and skills when it comes to using 3d aspects in games.
